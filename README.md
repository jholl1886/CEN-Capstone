Capstone project for Spring 2024, Jacob, Krenn, Josiah and Aditi and Reece
command for website: npm i react-bootstrap bootstrap react-icons  
in the root install these which help not having to restart server everytime you make a change to the code : npm i -D nodemon concurrently

Maybe we will need : npm i axios
